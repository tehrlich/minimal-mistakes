Tyler Ehrlich is a second year Master’s graduate student at the University of Georgia studying conducting and completing his public school teaching certification. At UGA, Tyler's responsibilities involve all aspects of the band program including conducting, logistics, and instruction of the concert bands, undergraduate conducting courses, Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, and the Redcoat Marching Band.

Tyler graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from Cornell University where his studies concentrated in music and computer science. He served as a teaching assistant for the Cornell Wind Ensembles where his responsibilities included both conducting and administration. For three years Tyler assisted in conducting the Commencement Wind Ensemble with over 30,000 faculty, students, and family members in attendance. He also directed seven pit orchestras for Ithaca's largest student musical theater organization, The Melodramatics Theatre Company. During his final semester, Tyler conducted Cornell University's Mainstage musical, Stephen Sondheim’s <i>Company</i>. His principal conducting teachers in Ithaca were Cynthia Johnston Turner, Stephen Peterson, Chris Younghoon Kim, and James Spinazzola. As a clarinetist, Tyler performed with the Cornell Wind Ensembles, Symphony Orchestra, chamber ensembles, and premiered several student compositions.

Funded by research grants from the Consortium of College and University Media Centers and UGA’s Ideas for Creative Exploration Lab, Tyler has worked with Cynthia Johnston Turner to bring their ideas involving conducting technology to fruition. He has done all of the programming for their projects, and has presented with her at several of the largest band conferences in the world: The College Band Directors National Association National Conference, The World Association of Symphonic Bands and Ensembles International Conference, and The Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic. Work that he has completed has been sourced by academic articles, published in <i>The Verge, USA Today</i>, discussed on American Public Media's <i>Performance Today</i>, and applauded by developers at Google. In addition to his work with Glass, Tyler held programming positions at Cornell Information Technologies, the Lab of Ornithology, and the Cornell Department of Music.
