They have presented their research at several of the largest band conferences in the world: the College Band Directors National Association National Conference, the World Association of Symphonic Bands and Ensembles International Conference, and the Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic. Work that he has completed has been published in <i>The Verge</i> and <i>USA Today</i>.
