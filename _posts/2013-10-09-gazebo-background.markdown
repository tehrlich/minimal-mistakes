**Title:** "Gazebo Dances for Band"

**Composer:** John Corigliano

**Structure:** The work is divided into four movements, played with short pauses between each.

**Instrumentation:** Standard wind band. The alto clarinet has an important part, but it's cued in alto saxophone. The third movement has two extended solos for oboe. The percussion parts are not individual, but all scored together in a large booklet. In order to cover all of the parts, nine players are necessary in total.

**Performance Times** 
>Movement 1 &mdash; Overture: ~4:45 

>Movement 2 &mdash; Waltz: ~2:45

>Movement 3 &mdash; Adagio: ~4:45

>Movement 4 &mdash; Tarantella: ~2:30

>Total: ~14 minutes. G. Schirmer lists the total time as 17 minutes, but the vast majority of recordings (with the exception of the University of Texas Wind Ensemble) are less than that time.

**Publisher:** G. Schirmer. The work is available on rental only. The score is not available for purchase.

**Errata Posted?:** No, but I've assembled a list [here]({{ site.url }}/gazebo-errata.html).

**Level:** "Gazebo Dances" is not graded on the standard 1-6 scale, but advanced technique and exposed writing make this work only accessible to advanced ensembles.

**Texts Available:**

>Olfert, Warren D. "An Analysis of John Corigliano's 'Gazebo Dances' for Band." Journal of Band Research, 29:1 (1993: Fall) p. 25-42.

Olfert's essay is the definitive essay on "Gazebo Dances for Band." In the article, Olfert briefly provides background on the work, before diving into a thorough harmonic analysis of each movement independently. Although he discusses main themes and ideas, he does not provide a list of errata or more interpretative performance considerations (for example: balance, blend, and tempo considerations.) Nonetheless, it's a wonderful read and extremely useful for score study.

>Hinton, Eric L. "Conducting the Wind Orchestra: Meaning, Gesture, and Expressive Potential." Amherst, N.Y: Cambria Press, 2008.

Hinton's book discusses conducting considerations for the first movement of "Gazebo Dances", "Music for Prague 1968" by Karel Husa, "Celebration" by Edward Gregson, and "Morning Music" by Richard Rodney Bennett. In the chapter on "Gazebo Daces", Hinton first discusses main themes, and relates them to other works by composers such as Stravinsky, Sousa, and Fillmore. These relationships provide interesting performance practice decisions, but I still think it's important that conductors consider these relationships under their own advisement. They are well thought out and justified, but without coming from Corigliano's pen, they are still only one conductor's interpretation.

In another section, Hinton discusses conducting decisions about the work. The first topic relates to the opening measure. Since the ensemble enters after an eighth rest, the conductor can provide two silent beats, one silent beat, or simply a strong downbeat. Hinton immediately discards the last of these stating, "it does not provide the player with enough information with regard to tempo, nor does it allow the player an opportunity to take an ample breath. This approach forces the ensemble to guess the length of the first note and therefore fails on the grounds that it lacks clarity."

Although I greatly respect Hinton's views and agree with most of his ideas about "Gazebo Dances", I vehemently disagree with this statement. Assuming the conductor uses a consistent tempo throughout the rehearsal period, confirms the ensemble is ready before starting the work, and clearly discusses the style of the opening of movement, I firmly believe providing a strong gesture of syncopation emphasizes the explosive nature the opening of this work calls for.

Due to the number of unique parallels Hinton draws between the opening movement of "Gazebo Dances for Band" and other works, I highly recommend this chapter.
