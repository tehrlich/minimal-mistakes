	 </thead>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Percussion</td>
		<td>I, II, III, and IV</td>
		<td>The score never indicates cymbal choices. Although it's generally obvious, the first movement is considerably crisper in sound when a stick is used with a suspended cymbal versus traditional crash cymbals.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>I, m.24</td>
		<td>Flute 2 is missing a tie between beats 2 and 3.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>I, m.74</td>
		<td>Ambiguous marking; the solo is in clarinet 2.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Trumpet 2</td>
		<td>I, m.139</td>
		<td><i>Not entirely errata, but an observation.</i>Trumpet 1 and 3 are <i>senza sord.</i>, but trumpet 2 is muted. The score reminds trumpet 2 at m.135 to be muted, but it seems odd that two thirds of the trumpets would be open on a unison line.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Percussion</td>
		<td>I, m.139</td>
		<td><i>Not entirely errata, but an observation.</i> There is no crash cymbal hit on beat 1, but the orchestral version and the recording by the North Texas Wind Symphony includes it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>I, m.172</td>
		<td>The bells rhythm is difficult to read. It should be an eighth rest, two sixteenth notes on 'G', and an eighth note 'G' on beat 2.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Bassoon</td>
		<td>II, m.40</td>
		<td>Missing crescendo found in both baritone and bass parts.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Alto Sax 1</td>
		<td>II, m.83</td>
		<td>In the alto clarinet cue, the last eighth note should be an E and not a C#.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Percussion</td>
		<td>II, m.85</td>
		<td>Instrument is ambiguous; it should be triangle, not snare drum.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Flute 1</td>
		<td>II, m.107</td>
		<td>Key change is missing to E major.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Bassoon</td>
		<td>II, m.172</td>
		<td>Missing articulation on beat 1 &mdash; should be staccato and accent.</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Clarinet 2</td>
		<td>III, m.4</td>
		<td>Clarinet 2 has an incorrect tie. Both halves of the measures should have phrase marks, but not ties.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score</td>
		<td>III, m.24</td>
		<td>Trombone 1 & 2 is missing a slur from the "e" of beat 4 to beat 5. The part is correct.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tuba</td>
		<td>III, m.24</td>
		<td>The tuba part has an extra eighth note; the score is correct.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tuba</td>
		<td>III, m.25</td>
		<td>Missing time change to 4/4.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Percussion</td>
		<td>IV, m.175</td>
		<td>Measure marking 175 is located in the incorrect location.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Score and Percussion</td>
		<td>IV, mm.175-176</td>
		<td><i>Not entirely errata, but an observation.</i>A soft stick roll to a hard stick attack is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Two player are required, or it might be easier to simply have the roll be with sticks as well.</td>
	</tr>
