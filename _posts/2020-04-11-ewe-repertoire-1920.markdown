## Preface
I had the immense pleasure of serving as the conductor of the Emory Wind Ensemble for the 2019-2020 year. Over the course of the year, we explored a lot of exciting repertoire, for the students and me.

## "The Passions of the Soul" — Saturday, October 19, 2019
This program was based off of Decarte's final treatise, where he theorizes on "the passions," or modern day emotions. My hope was to explore a wide gamut of these, from joy to melancholy, regal to relaxed.

## "Fused" — Saturday, November 23rd, 2019
This was a particularly exciting concert, as it was shared with the Emory University Symphony Orchestra, and a featured component of the [Emory Percussion Symposium](http://emorywindensemble.org/emory-percussion-symposium/). Our portion of the concert celebrated fusions of repertoire (musical material, )
